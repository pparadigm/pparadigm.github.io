Hello, and welcome! For the past four years, I've spent a lot of time organizing and shelving books at the library, both as a volunteer and while being paid. I also have a Computer Science background and have a natural tendency to muse about how to execute my daily tasks more efficiently. Bookshelving is pretty mind-numbing and repetitive, and I do it frequently, so naturally this is an area in my life where I've spent some time optimizing.

Right now I want to talk about how I've optimized my path for a sweep, or tidying-up, of my library. My library focuses its services on babies, toddlers, kids, and their parents, so it can get messy very quickly, especially after a storytime. In order to sweep a library most effectively, you need to be familiar with its patterns, so here's a diagram of my library's patterns.

Part of the sweeping process in my library is collecting any books that are no longer shelved in their proper place. These books might be from (lovingly) ransacked displays, knocked off the shelves, or books people looked at but didn't want to check out. They can also be from a shelf that was perused so vigorously that a section of books are all askew to the point that you can't just straighten them back up and hope they'll be in their proper place anymore.

At my library, my sweep starts and ends in the staff area. Before I tell you how I go about my sweep, how would you go about it? You need to address every messy area, check all bookdrop bins, and at least visually inspect every pathway between bookshelves.
