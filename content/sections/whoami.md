I love to learn. Every time I find a new concept or topic that helps me understand the ones I'm already familiar with, I'll spend at least hours looking up all I can about the subjectâ€”its vocabulary, quirks, and secrets. 

Right now I'm most knowledgeable about libraries, particularly when it comes to organizing their materials. I have a background in computer science, and have diverse interests, including video games and their development, cybersecurity, natural languages, psychology, social engineering, jigsaw puzzles, nail art, reading, writing, cooking and baking, drawing, and crafting.

You might find blog posts about any and all of these things on this site.
